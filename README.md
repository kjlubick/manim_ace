Animated Code Execution, powered by Manim (https://manim.community)

This does not have a guaranteed stable API.

This is not an official Manim project.

See `sample_code.py` for a small example and sample_code.mp4 for the output

See `connect_four.py` for a full example. The output will be on my YouTube
channel (https://www.youtube.com/@KevinLubick) when I'm done editing it (hopefully Feb 2023).
Bear in mind that I wrote `connect_four.py` to run *once*,
but spent a bit more time on the code in `manim_ace` to be more reusable across projects.

If you use this code (or a fork) to generate videos, those videos are yours to do what you like with.
